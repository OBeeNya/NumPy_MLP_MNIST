# NumPy_MLP_MNIST

The objective of this project was to create a Multi-Layer Perceptron using only the NumPy library.

Doing so allowed me to showcase both proficiency in basic Python programming and a good understanding of the artificial neural network.

I then used the created object to train a model on the famous MNIST dataset in order to test its efficiency.
